  //comparing 2 arrays that they are equal or not
  //we are using every()


//The every() method executes a function for each array element.

//The every() method returns true if the function returns true for all elements.

//The every() method returns false if the function returns false for one element.

//The every() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

//The every() method does not change the original array


 // Creating two arrays, arr1 and arr2, both containing string elements '1', '2', and '3'.
const arr1 = ['1','2','3'];
const arr2 = ['1','2','3'];


 // Checking if the length of arr1 is equal to the length of arr2.
if(arr1.length == arr2.length){
  console.log(arr1.every(checkingElements));// Using the every() method to check if every element in arr1 satisfies the condition specified by the checkingElements function.

  //If the lengths are not equal, it skips the element-wise comparison because arrays of different lengths cannot be equal. This helps optimize the code by avoiding unnecessary and potentially time-consuming operations when it's already known that the arrays are not of the same length

}

  return element == arr2[index];// Comparing the current element of arr1 with the corresponding element of arr2 at the same index.
