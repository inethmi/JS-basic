  //method 1
  const arrNum = [1,2,3,4,2,3,1,3];
  let seen = {}; //This initializes an empty object to keep track of unique elements.
  console.log(arrNum.filter(duplicates)); //The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

  function duplicates(num){
    if(seen[num]){
      return num //if the argument pass from the array as the parameter 'num' is already a key in the 'seen' object, that means it has been encountered before,and its returned as a element in the newly created array
    }else{
      seen[num] = true; //if not it is added to 'seen' with the value true to indicate that it has been seen
    }
  } 



  //method 2
  const arrNum2 = [1,2,3,5,5,4,3,2,3,2,1];
  let seen2 = {};
  let duplicate = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < arrNum2.length; i++){

      duplicate.push(arrNum2[i]);
    }
    else{
      seen2[arrNum2[i]] = true;
    }
  }

  console.log(duplicate)

  let keys = Object.keys(seen2);
  console.log("list of numbers without duplicates : " , keys);// order of keys in the array is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were added to the object.If you need a specific order, you might want to sort the keys before displaying them.






  
  /*difference between filter() and find() method

    The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

    The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.
